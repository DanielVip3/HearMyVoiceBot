## About
discord.js is a powerful [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) module that allows you to easily interact with the
[Discord API](https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/intro).

- Object-oriented
- Predictable abstractions
- Performant
- 100% coverage of the Discord API

## Installation
**Node.js 10.0.0 or newer is required.**  
Ignore any warnings about unmet peer dependencies, as they're all optional.

Without voice support: `npm install discordjs/discord.js`  
With voice support ([node-opus](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-opus)): `npm install discordjs/discord.js node-opus`  
With voice support ([opusscript](https://www.npmjs.com/package/opusscript)): `npm install discordjs/discord.js opusscript`

### Audio engines
The preferred audio engine is node-opus, as it performs significantly better than opusscript. When both are available, discord.js will automatically choose node-opus.
Using opusscript is only recommended for development environments where node-opus is tough to get working.
For production bots, using node-opus should be considered a necessity, especially if they're going to be running on multiple servers.

### Optional packages
- [zlib-sync](https://www.npmjs.com/package/zlib-sync) for faster WebSocket data inflation (`npm install zlib-sync`)
- [zucc](https://www.npmjs.com/package/zucc) for significantly faster WebSocket data inflation (`npm install zucc`)
- [erlpack](https://github.com/discordapp/erlpack) for significantly faster WebSocket data (de)serialisation (`npm install discordapp/erlpack`)
- One of the following packages can be installed for faster voice packet encryption and decryption:
    - [sodium](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sodium) (`npm install sodium`)
    - [libsodium.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/libsodium-wrappers) (`npm install libsodium-wrappers`)
- [uws](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@discordjs/uws) for a much faster WebSocket connection (`npm install @discordjs/uws`)
- [bufferutil](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bufferutil) for a much faster WebSocket connection when *not* using uws (`npm install bufferutil`)

## Example usage
```js
const Discord = require('discord.js');
const client = new Discord.Client();

client.on('ready', () => {
  console.log(`Logged in as ${client.user.tag}!`);
});

client.on('message', msg => {
  if (msg.content === 'ping') {
    msg.reply('pong');
  }
});

client.login('token');
```
